BUILT UPON THE ELECTRON REACT BOILERPLATE

AN EXPERIMENT TO CONNECT MONGODB SERVERS WITH REACT NATIVE. 
ESSENTIALLY A TEST TO SEE HOW FAR I CAN PUSH REACT NATIVE WHILE USING A LOW LEVEL POWER MACBOOK.


As per completion, worked pretty well with the only issue being a slight delay for server requests...
need to impliment a memory request system thats lightweight and utilises changes with the database size rather that the request itself to inhibit excess use of data pulls.
